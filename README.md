# EDA-Diagnosing-Diabetes

Codecademy project to practice EDA skills recently learned as part of the Inspect, Clean and Validate a Dataset module of the Exploratory Data Analysis in Python lesson for the Data Scientist: Analytics Specialist Career Path Certificate Program.

The dataset comes from here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database

My solution can be found in the EDA Diagnosing Diabetes.Travis.ipynb Jupyter Notebook contained in this repository.


Codecademy Project Text:
DATA SCIENTIST: ANALYTICS SPECIALIST
EDA: Diagnosing Diabetes
In this project, you’ll imagine you are a data scientist interested in exploring data that looks at how certain diagnostic factors affect the diabetes outcome of women patients.

You will use your EDA skills to help inspect, clean, and validate the data.

Note: This dataset is from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. It contains the following columns:

Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure
SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin
BMI: Body mass index
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
Age: Age (years)
Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1)
Let’s get started!

Open EDA Diagnosing Diabetes.ipynb and follow the steps in the Jupyter Notebook. If you get stuck, you can look at EDA Diagnosing Diabetes_Solution.ipynb for the answer.
